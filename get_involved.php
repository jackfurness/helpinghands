				<p>Helping Hands welcomes skilled volunteers to work as part of the team alongside current staff members. There are many opportunities to get involved in a range of different areas.</p>
				<p>Some of the professional skills we are looking for include the following:</p>
				<ul class="">
					<li>Teachers (to provide support and staff training)
						<ul class="">
						    <li>Primary (Elementary) school level</li>
						    <li>Special Education Needs</li>
						    <li>Weaving</li>
						    <li>Sewing, dressmaking, knitting, quilting, bag making</li>
						    <li>Arts and Crafts (such as screen printing, beading, painting, glass work)</li>
					    </ul>
					</li>
					<li>Occupational Therapists</li>
					<li>Physiotherapists </li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you would like more information, please <a href="#">contact us</a>.</p>
				<h2 class="text-center"><span class="ribbon">Finances</span></h2>
				<p>At Helping Hands, we believe in being open and accountable to our supporters. We rely on local and international donations. These funds are used entirely to support the projects run by Helping Hands in Kenya.</p> 
				<p>We are working towards making our projects self-sustainable for the longer term. Any profits from sales are therefore reinvested back into the projects. We also try to make use of volunteers, wherever possible, to keep administrative costs down.</p>
				<p>The students inspire us daily and help us to keep pushing the project further, but we cannot do this alone. If you would like to support us financially, your donation could help subsidise expenses for families in severe financial need. These following figures represent approximate costs at this time:</p>
				<h3 class="delta">A Little Hands student with disabilities:</h3>
				<ul>
				    <li>Tuition fees (which includes lunch) are Ksh 3500 per month (GBP 30, Euro 35, C$40)</li>
					<li>Safe transportation for day students: Ksh 3500 per month (GBP 30, Euro 35, C$40)</li>
			    </ul>
				<h3 class="delta">A Skilful Hands student:</h3>
				<ul>
				    <li>Tuition fees are Ksh 3000 per month (GBP 25, Euro 30, C$40)</li>
				    <li>Boarding fees (which includes meals) are Ksh 3000 per month (GBP 25, Euro 30, C$40)</li>
					<li>Safe transportation for day students: Ksh 3500 per month (GBP 30, Euro 35, C$40)</li>
			    </ul>
				<p>There are several other financial expenses where donations will make an impact. We are adding classroom space and live-in quarters to our newest building as well as adding another education block. Electricity, plumbing, painting, floor tiling and furbishing are still required. We will also need to replace the school van with a larger bus so that we can continue to provide students with safe transportation to and from school. The van needs to accommodate wheelchairs.</p>
				<h3 class="delta">Transportation</h3>
				<ul>
				    <li>Larger school bus costs Ksh 3,000,000 (GBP 23,000 Euro 29,000 C$ 36,000)   </li>
			    </ul>      
				<p>Any donation, large or small, is very much appreciated.</p>
