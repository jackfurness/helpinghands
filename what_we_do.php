				<p>Little Hands School started as a nursery (kindergarten) but it continues to grow and now accepts children up to lower primary level. The school welcomes children of all abilities from the local community. The vision of the school is to create both a model and an inclusive programme, based on Christian values. </p>					
				<p>Children with physical disabilities are integrated into the various aspects of school life. They study alongside their non-disabled friends. This way the children all learn to respect and understand each other’s differences. Children with special needs are also given additional one-to-one support.</p>

				<p>We believe that investing in our staff is a key element to the growth and success of the school. Teachers therefore take part in ongoing professional development programmes. The Montessori teaching methods are incorporated into the school curriculum and teachers look at different ways of delivering a creative and challenging Kenyan syllabus for children of all abilities. They are also encouraged and trained to be inclusive in their teaching style to ensure that no child is left out.</p>
				<h3 class="text-center"><span class="ribbon">Skilful hands</span></h3>
				<p>Here at Helping Hands, both young people and adults have the opportunity to learn a marketable skill. We provide vocational training in weaving, art, and tailoring. Students are taught the importance of good work ethics, such as integrity, punctuality, and the need to produce goods of a very high quality. We also encourage students to grow in their personal and Christian faith by participating in weekly discipleship courses, daily prayer, and reflection. </p>

				<p>The vast majority of Kenya’s population is made up of young people. Nearly half of the Kenyan population is less than 15 year of age and 46% of the population lives below the poverty line (UNICEF, 2008; World Health Organization & The World Bank, 2011). This means that many youths will not have the opportunity to pursue or complete secondary education. Our aim is to challenge our students to learn a vocation and to earn their own living.</p>
				<h3 class="text-center"><span class="ribbon">Leadership training</span></h3>
				<p>The church in Kenya is growing faster than leaders can be trained (Gathere, 2009). Many local Kenyan church leaders and over 76% of pastors have little or no access to any formal theological training. In recent years a large percentage of the Kenyan population has been affected by inflation, post-election violence, and drought; consequently, only 20% of Pastors who reported to various schools could pay their tuition. At Helping Hands, training to meet these needs is provided, and continues to be crucial.</p>

				<p>Helping Hands runs an accredited Diploma course in Transformational Leadership in association with Pan Africa Christian University in Nairobi. It covers a broad range of courses including: a study of the core books of the Bible, the history and value of missions, the church in Africa, and leadership skills. The programme is tailored for young people and for church and community leaders. It is designed to accommodate people who are working.</p>

				<p>Naivasha International Fellowship began in 2005. Initially, it was a small gathering in a home. It has grown into a larger multi-cultural and multi-denominational church family.  </p>
				<p>We meet every Sunday at 10:30 AM at Helping Hands, in the training centre itself, Lakeview Estate, Naivasha. Alongside our weekly Sunday service, we run a Kids’ Church for children, ages 0 to 11 years. There our children learn more about God’s story and the work of the Holy Spirit. It is also a time for fun and laughter so that the children grow together in love and their knowledge of Jesus.</p>
				<p>Once a month we have a family service. This is a wonderful time for the whole church family to gather together by offering praise, worship, prayer, and by using the opportunity to continue to learn more about God—regardless of one’s age!</p>
				<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5290234/helpinghands/wwa/wwa_4.jpg" alt="Womens group" class="img-responsive">
				<p>There is a women’s group that meets every week for Bible study, fun, fellowship, great coffee, and cakes! Meeting locations alternate in different home settings.</p>
