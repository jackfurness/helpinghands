				<p>Helping Hands Organisation of Kenya is an independent Christian charity that provides opportunities for education and training to disadvantaged adults, youth, and children. The programme for children runs from kindergarten through lower primary. Adults are offered a full range of life skills including entrepreneurship, leadership abilities, and Bible training for local church leaders.</p>

				<p>Our non-profit organisation brings individuals from the local community and outlying areas together for a unique experience. Based in Naivasha, within the Great Rift Valley region of Kenya, the student body is growing. We now have over 100 students. Small well equipped classrooms allow learners to receive individualised attention. Courses are open to anyone, though those with physical challenges and financial difficulties are given priority. Job training and personal development seminars are also available for teachers. </p>

				<p>In 1962, Rev. Dr. Hellmut and Elsie Mascher became pioneer teachers and church planters in Kenya. Over the years they were also involved in a variety of projects in Tanzania. Most of their time was spent working with missions in church related education and with the Kenya Government in secondary schools.</p>

				<p>The vision for Helping Hands originally came into being in the early 1990s. One day when Hellmut and Elsie visited a former church plant in Maasai country, Narok District, they were shocked to discover that a young man with a physical disability had lived beside the church for many years, yet none of the neighbours knew of his existence. He had been kept out of sight from anyone outside of the family all his life. Throughout that time he never had a chance to learn, nor had he been able to develop social, relational or physical skills. This was a revelation, particularly when it was discovered that he was not alone; many others live in similar conditions.</p>
				<p>With this discovery, the vision for Helping Hands Organisation was born. Helping Hands would become a place which would welcome, encourage, and actively promote people with physical challenges. Every classroom would be wheelchair accessible. An inclusive policy would also be promoted by making each programme available to others who would benefit. In this way Helping Hands could provide assistance to the community while avoiding the stigma which often hinders schools for people with disabilities.</p>
				<p>In October 1997, negotiations were made to purchase property for an educational multi-purpose centre. Construction began in 1998 and teaching soon afterwards. Today, a larger outworking of that vision has been realized.</p>

				<p>Since the start date, volunteers have come to assist with building and teaching projects. Also, full-time staff members have been added. With ongoing teamwork, and through local and international partnerships, there is still much more that can be done. Over the years, numerous students have come through the doors of the school and have thereby gained a more promising future.</p>
				<p>Attitudes towards people with disabilities are changing in Kenya. But there is still great room for improvement. The published disability rates for Kenya rose in the last decade from less than 1% in 2004 to 8.6% in 2011 (Mitra, Posarac, & Vick, 2011, Mont, 2007). While the difference is largely due to massive underreporting in prior years, findings also show that global rates are increasing because of rising costs in healthcare (World Health Organization & The World Bank, 2011).  In 2011, more specific findings for Kenya indicated that disability rates were higher in rural than urban areas, and the prevalence rates for women were double that of men.</p>
				<p>While the average completion rate for lower primary education was just over three years for all Kenyans, only 59% of individuals with disabilities finished primary school compared to 74% of people without disabilities (World Health Organization & The World Bank, 2011). Approximately half of the households with disabled persons fell below the USA $1.25/day poverty line, and only 34% of Kenyans with disabilities were employed. Helping Hands aims to do what they can to provide an answer for those who struggle under these conditions.</p>
				<h3 class="text-center"><span class="ribbon">Our vision</span></h3>
				<p>The heart of our vision is to be an inclusive centre and to empower local people through education and training. We particularly want to help people with disabilities as they often face the most challenges.</p>
				<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5290234/helpinghands/wwa/wwa_9.jpg" alt="Children playing" class="img-responsive">
				<p>In addition to the life skills training, we also believe equipping people spiritually is important. As an inclusive centre, we hope to break down stereotypes and prejudices to raise awareness about the difficulties faced by individuals with disabilities.</p>
				<h3 class="text-center"><span class="ribbon">Our committee</span></h3>
				<p>Centre activities are run by a committed group of local men and women. This team reflects the diversity of the people we aspire to help.</p>
